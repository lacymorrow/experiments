# Experiments and Projects

A collection of labs, experiments, and other interesting code-stuffs. *mostly outdated.*


## Included:

All of the projects are independent. Some are complete, others are not.

### Flashpress

Flashpress is a Flash front-end for any WordPress, Moveable Type, or Blogger blog with an XML–RPC interface. It interfaces with your blog to provide, super–fast editing without reloading pages. It contains a built-in text interface based off of the open–source Obedit. Interface offers basic creation/deletion and editing of posts, as well as a login cookie for quick login.

Use `demo` for both the username and password.


### Gallery

Gallery is a severe reincarnation of Viewr. It offers a wide range of selectable options, loaded through an external XML file. It can be used to display any number of images in many different ways, with great transition effects. It is now fully functional and provides an excellent and professional image slideshow through Flash 8. It was created for use on IACMusic.com.

Features:

 * Load almost any type of image.
 * Easily load images from Flickr.
 * Add a custom watermark.
 * Load background music, set volume.
 * Show individual or global captions for each image.
 * Start on any image or play from start.
 * Automatic resizing to fit, or crop to screen.
 * Set individual or global durations for photos.
 * Individual or global links.
 * Loop playlist option.
 * Control slideshow with keyboard.
 * Shuffle or play in order.
 * Choose from 14 transitions, or set to random.
 * Random transition subsets make for a total of 101 possible effects.


### Generative Art

Experiments in generative art using Flash.


### Giga Player

The Giga Player was created to be a radically feature-filled web music player for budding artists and labels alike. Features buying or saving in multiple file formats, album art, personal playlist features (save/add/remove), drag–n–drop rearranging, and a powerful Javascript API for full integration. Sadly, the budget was cut and the project was never finished. It’s now available here with the full source. Click and drag a song to reorder.


### Image Font Generator

A PHP script which converts a string into an image of any size of color, using any truetype font provided. Before web fonts were supported by most browsers, this was the script I used to generate headers in custom fonts.


### Image Viewr

Viewr is a Flash web application that uses the Flickr API to dynamically load interesting photos at random, or according to specified parameters. It was designed from the beginning to be as tiny as possible, weighing in at <3kb. Written entirely in Actionscript with zero Flash symbols. Basic customization is available, to refine which images are displayed, and how the user can interact with the movie.


### Interactive Media Interface 

[Demo](http://lacymorrow.com/projects/offline/cee)

A complex media interface created as a proof-of-concept in Flash. Displays news, music, photos, and videos in a novel way. It is outdated, so many features are now broken but the idea and uniqueness remains. Click and drag a topic to the center and play around.


### iTunes Library XML Wrapper

**Obsolete.** An iTunes library to XML/XSPF converter. Works with like, iTunes 4. Scans an iTunes library and returns a formatted playlist file. Bundled as a Flash component. 


### PHP CRUD App

An complete CRUD *(create/read/update/delete)* application written in PHP. Manages a public library-style checkout system which allows students to rent or "check-out" instruments from any number of schools in the system. Uses the [Flintstone](https://github.com/fire015/flintstone/) flat-file database library and Bootstrap. Admin account user `admin@admin.com` and password `administrator`.


### TI Games

[Featured on ticalc.org](http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/99/9999.html)

A collection of finished and unfinished games and utilities written in BASIC for the TI-83/84/+. Completed apps:

**Drawout**: A drawing application with a few features and enhancements.

**Jackpot**: A casino-style slot machine, using characters rather than images.

**Jumper**: My personal favorite, a simple jumper. Press the button, jump over the whole.

**Matches**: Also called Nim, a classic two-player puzzle game. Play a friend or the computer. Force your opponent to take the last match.

**Mazeworm**: A complex snake-esque game. Make your way through increasingly difficult mazes without touching the walls. Accepts custom maps.

**RPS**: Rock-Paper-Scissors.

**Tic-Tac**: Tic-Tac-Toe.

**Trigger**: An assasination game modeled after the Sniper assembly games.

**Whack**: Whack-a-mole on your calculator.
